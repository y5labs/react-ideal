# React Ideal

This is an example project that integrates a flat structure ("frameworkless") into React. A hub and inject pattern are available. Additionally a router has been implemented along with updating state.

The build system is vite with esbuild.

Stylus is implemented as an example css pre-processor.

Define is used as an example to have a different API url between development and production.

Dependencies have been kept to a minimum.

## Future

1. Explore concurrency beta features.
2. Integrate GraphQL
3. favicon generation, svg minification, etc, etc.
4. Is there a simple router that can replace what's available here?
